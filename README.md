Darker Side Of Vola
===================

High contrast theme for [Volafile](https://volafile.org).
I tried few bitsized True Type fonts but such fonts are
shit when antialiasing comes into play so I decided to leave it with default font.
Only layout change for now is making top bar smaller and fitting all the buttons in it.

Installation
------------

Get [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) already!

After getting it, just click [this.](https://github.com/Szero/darker-side-of-vola/raw/master/extension/darker.user.js)

Thanks

- To dad for creating [css](https://userstyles.org/styles/103946/as-dark-as-my-soul) as a base for it.
