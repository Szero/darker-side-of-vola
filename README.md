Darker Side Of Vola
===================

High contrast theme for [Volafile](https://volafile.io).
I tried few bitsized True Type fonts but such fonts are
shit when antialiasing comes into play so I decided to leave it with default font.
Only layout change for now is making top bar smaller and fitting all the buttons in it.

Installation
------------

Go to extension folder, open the `darker.user.js` file and click the Raw button. Greasemonkey will do the rest.

- To dad for creating [css](https://userstyles.org/styles/103946/as-dark-as-my-soul) as a base for it.
